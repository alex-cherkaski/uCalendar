## Iteration 3 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Mar 29, 2018
 * Where: LM (Lash Miller Laboratories) 155

## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well

* Trello task board
  * The task board allowed us to know exactly which tasks we needed to complete and what stage of development each task was at
  * Allowed us to see and plan for future tasks

* Working directly on the repository
  * Because we worked mostly on isolated parts of code and based on past experience didn't have many merge conflicts, this method of working allowed us to work efficiently and not have to worry about all the separate forks/branches.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

 * Having only one dedicated person working on the UI
   * This proved to make implementation difficult as this person was a lot more familiar with the front end code compared to the rest of the group
   * At any point, when we needed a front end feature to be implemented, that sole person was the only one who could complete it in a timely manner

* Facebook group chat
  * During this iteration, the Facebook group chat was not as active as we had hoped (probably due to other course loads, exam time, etc).
  * As a result, it felt like members were moreso working indvidual and not collaborating as much as we should have


#### Planned changes

As this is the last iteration, we don't have any planned changes. However, working on our own forks would have enforced frequent code reviews and encouraged more collaboration. So, instead of having each member work directly on the repository, we would work on our own forks if we were to continue this project.


## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

We were able to complete the serializer/deserializer for users' calendars (see below). We decided to use the most straightforward and convenient way to implement is (which was using the Java .ser file) as we had no specific requirements which would have influenced how we chose to serialize the calendars. 

We also we able to implement the Dropbox API into our application. In addition to this, we have added support to allow users to not only upload files, but also create folders and delete files in the linked Dropbox (see below).

We met our final goal of making the UI look more appealing and intuitive (see below). This was an important task for us to get done for this final iteration as a user has to be able to easily navigate through the app when using it.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

As this was the final iteration, we made a strong effort to accomplish all the goals we planned in the plan document. We were able to do this, so we did not have any goals/tasks from the plan.md we did not complete. However, if we had more time, we would have liked to add more functionality to the UI such as displaying conflicts in calendars. 

## Meeting Highlights

Our first insight going into the next iteration is to make sure that we are all clear on all aspects of the codebase. This is important as the next stage of the project will be presenting a live demo to the instructors. We need to understand all the features that were implemented and how they were implemented so that we will be comfortable explaining our thought processes to the instructors.

Another insight we have going into the demo is that we need to make sure we are all comfortable reflecting on our project process; we need to be able to reflect on the challenges we faced working as a group. We will also need to be able to elaborate on all the bugs we faced when implementing features and what we learned from organizing a large scale project in a relatively large team.
