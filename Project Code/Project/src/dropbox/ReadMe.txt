 * NOTE: You will only need to do this once.
 * In Eclipse, right click on JRE System Library on the left.
 * Go to Build Path and click on Configure Build Path...
 * Click on Get External JARS...
 * Find the .jar files in 'DropboxJars' and add them to the project.
 * The errors should be gone now.
 * IMPORTANT: when you commit don't just commit the entire Project folder. Make sure you are not committing the actual .jar files.
