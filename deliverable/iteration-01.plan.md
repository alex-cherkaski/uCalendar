 ## Product
 
 #### Goals and tasks 
The main purpose that we have this iteration is to figure out exactly what our product is and who will use it. The goals that we have to accomplish this seem to go hand in hand as they kind of follow from one another. The goal of what to make the app about stems from what problems the user group faces, the kind of problems this user group faces is dependant on the user group. This then implies the main topics: the user base, what problems these people suffer from, and what solution we are providing. Following these, we then have to figure out what features our app will have and what tools we need to accomplish these. Listed below are the main goals and their tasks organized by importance:

User base:  
* the simple task of finding a user base to create a solution for is actually a key part of finding a solution for the main reason that different user groups can face different problems, therefore requiring a different solution.  
* the tasks required for this are:  
  * identifying the user group that we want to focus on  
  * possibly a user group that we associate with in order to feel more inclined to actually proceed with an app

Problem:  
* One of the most important things to consider is what problem are we solving, without this we can run into problems such as implementation without a purpose and the number of users that may actually use the app.  
* the tasks required for this are:  
  * identifying a user base  
  * figuring out what problems these user have, possibly through  interviews or questionnaires
  * what current apps this user base is using to work around the problem.

Solution:  
* after finding out what the potential problem the user base is having, the next most important thing is to find a solution to this problem.  
* the tasks required for this are:  
  * understanding the problem the user base has  
  * knowing the features of the apps the users are using right now  
  * is there any features these apps are missing and what can we do to improve them  
  * can we even repurpose a preexisting app?

App implementation:  
* then finally is the goal of how to implement the desired solution. This is an important goal but is ranked less as this goal canâ€™t be completed without the prior being finished.  
* the tasks required for this are:  
  * from a possible solution, which possible features are required  
  * from a set of features that we wish to add, how do we actually implement them  
  * figure out the GUI of the app and the backend explaining how it functions  
  * we need to figure out if we are using a pre existing API or creating a new one  
  * whether we will be working local (for one user) or using a server (multiple users)  
  * the platform we will be designing our app on, either mobile or desktop

#### Artifacts

* Mock-up of the interface and respective dialog windows.
*This artifact is for the purpose of having a visual representation of the interface that can be used to decide what works and what needs to be removed. 
* Dummy class schedules to showcase the process of generating meeting times.
*This will allow us to show our interpretation of how it should work and receive feedback about whether our interpretation is in line with what others consider good.
* Video/gif demonstration of sharing notes between users
*This artifact serves the same purpose as the above but in a different format.
* A partially/fully coded algorithm to show how we would generate times where all the set of student who want to meet are available.
*Allowing students to get together is an important aspect of our application so showing a concrete idea of how we are planning to tackle this problem is very beneficial.
