# uCalendar

A semester long project of cloud based and GUI driven self organization and note sharing app aimed at post secondary students. App users are able to store, retrieve, and view course notes for individual classes as well as share them on a common repository. An in-app calendar interface allows students to keep track of important academic events and set reminders.
